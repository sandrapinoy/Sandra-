            <h2> SHS </h2>
            <p> Senior High School (SHS) refers to the final two years of secondary education, typically grades 11 and 12, which prepare students for higher education, employment, or entrepreneurship. Students choose a specific track, such as Academic (e.g., STEM, HUMSS), Technical-Vocational-Livelihood, Arts and Design, or Sports, to specialize their learning in preparation for their future. </p>

<h3>HUMSS</h3>
<p>The Humanities and Social Sciences (HUMSS) strand is an academic track in Senior High School that focuses on the study of human behavior, society, culture, and the arts. It equips students with critical thinking, communication, and social awareness skills, preparing them for college courses such as journalism, psychology, law, and education. The curriculum includes subjects like Philippine Politics and Governance, Discipline and Ideas in Social Sciences, and Creative Writing.</p> 
<h4>ICT</h4>
<p>The ICT (Information and Communication Technology) strand is a senior high school program under the Technical-Vocational Livelihood (TVL) track that provides students with skills in information technology, such as computer systems, programming, and web design. It prepares students for careers or further education in the tech industry by teaching them practical skills in areas like software and network engineering, animation, graphic arts, and more. Earning a National Certificate (NC) upon passing TESDA assessments can also help graduates find employment immediately after high school.
